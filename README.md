Yonder utilizes big data to connect pastoralist communities with information on water availability and weather to prepare and support their migration journeys.    
    
## Maximal Access    

We developed 3 possible mediums to accommodate the widest possible range of users: A web app, a mobile app, and an SMS-based service. Our solutions are deliberately lo-fi because of the likelihood of limited data connections or none at all.

## Technologies/APIs

* Waterpoint Data Exchange (Socrata) for data on water sources.
* Weather Underground API for weather data and alerts.
* Twilio API for SMS service.

## Future

We are working on providing data on grassland for pasture, safe routes, and legal information on land rights.
